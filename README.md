# WBDES-Orbital-Debris-Management
WBDES(Water Based Drag Enhancement System) uses controlled water vapor clouds to artificially increase drag on orbital debris, slowing it down and enabling natural re-entry without adding new space pollution.

# Problem Statement

Earth’s orbit is becoming increasingly congested with debris—from old satellites, rocket fragments, to micro-particles.
These objects travel at ~7–8 km/s, making them dangerous to active satellites and future space missions.
Current debris-removal methods (lasers, nets, harpoons, tugs) face challenges such as:

-High mission costs

-Complex capture mechanisms

-Risk of fragmentation

-Limited scalability

There is a need for a low-cost, safe, scalable, and physics-driven solution.

# Proposed Solution

Release controlled water mist / vapor clouds in orbit to create a temporary high-drag micro-environment.
When orbital debris passes through this cloud:

-Collides with water molecules

-Experiences increased drag

-Slows down

-Drops to lower orbit

-Eventually burns up in Earth’s atmosphere safely

This uses natural atmospheric mechanics with a lightweight, safe medium: water.
